[Gnu Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html)
-------------------------------------------------------------
The current directory (~/dot) is where stow commands are issued, and the target directory is assumed to be the parent of the current directory (~/). Each package given on the command line is the name of a package in the stow directory (e.g., emacs).  
How to operate stow:

navigate to your home directory

`cd ~`

enter the dotfiles directory

`cd dot`

install the bash settings

`stow bash`

uninstall bash settings

`stow -D bash`

rescan package for new files

`stow -R bash`


### Notes: ###
zsh function proxy is a stripped down version of Mike Santoro's wonderful proxy function.
